CoreMotionTeapot
================

CoreMotionTeapot is an application project that demonstrates how to receive and process accelerometer and device motion data. Using this data and OpenGL ES, the application animates  a teapot image in three-dimensional space.

Example project from WWDC 2010. Gone from Apple site. To save it for future generations, I've forked it. Hope I don't breach Apple copyright doing this.

All credits go to Apple.
